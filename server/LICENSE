Licensor:              Lifecycle AI, LLC.

Licensed Work:	       The Licensed Work is (c) 2024 Lifecycle AI, LLC.

Additional Use Grant:  You may make production use of the Licensed Work, provided 
                       that you may meet at least one of following criteria.

                       1. The total annual gross revenue of your Company, including
                          all its divisions, branches, and affiliated entities, for
                          the preceding fiscal year not exceed 2 million United
                          States Dollars (USD $2,000,000).

                       2. Not use the Licensed Work for an "Agent Service".
                          An "Agent Service" is a commercial offering that allows third
                          parties(other than your employees and contractors) to access
                          the functionality of the Licensed Work by performing an action
                          directly or indirectly that causes the creation of an agent in
                          the Licensed Work.

                          For clarity, an Agent Service would include providers of
                          infrastructure services, such as cloud services, hosting services,
                          data center services and similarly situated third parties (including
                          affiliates of such entities) that would offer the Licensed Work in
                          connection with a broader service offering to customers or subscribers
                          of such of such third party’s core services.

Change Date:           Four years from the release date. Please see [NPi Release](https://github.com/npi-ai/npi/releases/) for exact date.
