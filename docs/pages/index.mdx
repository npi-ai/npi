## What is NPi?

NPi (**N**atural-language **P**rogramming **I**nterface), pronounced as **"NÏ€"**, is an open-source software
providing **_Tool-use_** APIs to empower AI agents with the ability to operate and interact with a diverse array of
software and applications.

NPi can seamlessly integrate with popular technologies such as [OpenAI Assistant](integration/openai-assistant),
[LangChain](integration/langchain), CrewAI, etc.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

### Installation

Begin by installing the NPi AI package via pip:

```sh
pip install npiai
```

### Create a New Tool

Let's create a new tool to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Start by crafting a new Python file titled `main.py` and insert the following snippet:


```python filename="main.py" showLineNumbers {6-7, 13-16}
from npiai import FunctionTool, function

class MyTool(FunctionTool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name='my_tool',
            description='test tool',
        )

    @function
    def fibonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Get the nth Fibonacci number.

        Args:
            n: The index of the Fibonacci number in the sequence.
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)
```

### Use the Tool

You could use NPi tools in two different ways: `function mode` and `agent mode`. Let's explore both modes.

#### Function Mode

Function mode enables the integration of NPi tools with existing LLM-based AI agents. In this mode, tools are packaged
as callable functions that the AI agent can invoke in response to user prompts. In this mode, which function will be choose
decided by user-side agent.

```python filename="main.py" {4, 15, 21-22}
from openai import OpenAI

async def main():
    async with MyTool() as my_tool:
        client = OpenAI()
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What's the 10-th fibonacci number?",
            }
        ]
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=messages,
            tools=my_tool.tools,  # use npi as a tool package
            tool_choice="auto",
            max_tokens=4096,
        )
        response_message = response.choices[0].message

        # call the tool function corresponding to the response message
        result = await my_tool.call(response_message.tool_calls)

        print(result)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Agent Mode

Agent mode allows an NPi tools to serve as an independent Tool agents that can directly take plain queries and generate
responses. In this mode, the tool receives instructions, do `in-tool` planning to decide the sequence of function calling,
and returns the result as an output message. This mode simplify the problem-solving for domain-specific scenarios.
We suggest you use this mode in your Agentic AI applications.

```python filename="main.py" {1, 4-5}
from npiai import App, function, agent_wrapper

async def main():
    async with agent_wrapper(MyTool()) as agent:
        result = await agent.chat("What's the 10-th fibonacci number?")
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```
