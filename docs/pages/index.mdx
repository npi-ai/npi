## What is NPi?

NPi (**N**atural-language **P**rogramming **I**nterface), pronounced as **"N Ï€"**, is an open-source platform providing **_Tool-use_** APIs to empower AI agents with the ability to operate and interact with a diverse array of software tools and applications.

## Quick Start

<Steps>


### Installation

Begin by installing the NPi AI package via pip:

```bash bash
pip install npiai
```

### Create a New Tool

Let's create a new tool to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Start by crafting a new Python file titled `main.py` and insert the following snippet:

```python main.py mark=6:7,13:16
from npiai import FunctionTool, function

class MyTool(FunctionTool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name='my_tool',
            description='a tool can calculate fibonacci number',
        )

    @function
    def fibonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Get the nth Fibonacci number.

        Args:
            n: The index of the Fibonacci number in the sequence.
        """

        if n == 0:
            return 0

        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)

```

### Use the Tool

You could use NPi tools in two different ways: `function mode` and `agent mode`. Let's explore both modes.

#### Function Mode: Integration with Existing AI Agents

Function mode enables the integration of NPi tools with existing LLM-based AI agents. In this mode, tools are packaged as callable functions that the AI agent can invoke in response to user prompts. This integration allows developers to enrich
the AI's functionality by incorporating custom operations without altering the agent's core logic.

```python filename="main.py" mark=5,17,24:25
from openai import OpenAI

async def main():

    async with MyTool() as my_tool:
        client = OpenAI()
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What's the 10-th fibonacci number?",
            }
        ]

        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=messages,
            tools=my_tool.tools,  # use npi as a tool package
            tool_choice="auto",
            max_tokens=4096,
        )

        response_message = response.choices[0].message

        # call the tool function corresponding to the response message
        result = await my_tool.call(response_message.tool_calls)
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```


#### Agent Mode: Tool Execution as an Agent

Agent mode allows an NPi tools to serve as an independent AI agents that can directly take plain queries and generate
responses. In this mode, the tool will be converted to an agent that receives instructions, processes it internally
using its defined functions, and returns the result as an output message. This mode simplifies the creation of an
AI-powered programming interface for domain-specific scenarios. We suggest you use tool with this mode in your Agentic AI applications.

```python main.py
from npiai import App, function, agent_wrapper

async def main():
    async with agent_wrapper(MyTool()) as agent:
        result = await agent.chat("What's the 10-th fibonacci number?")

        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())

```
