# Overview

In this section, you will learn the core concepts of NPi and how to use it in your project.

## Why NPi

## Concepts

### Agent

An Agent is a program that follows human instructions to get task done by using various tools. In NPi, an Agent points
to two types of concepts: `App Agent` and `User Agent`.

An App Agent is provisioned Agent of NPi, users can use it out of the box, typically, an App Agent is seen as a **Tool**.

User Agent is a custom Agent that users use NPi SDK to create and can use various tools to perform specific tasks.

```python filename="examples/calendar_negotiator"
from openai import OpenAI

from npiai.core import Agent
from npiai.app.google import Gmail, Calendar
from npiai.app.human_feedback import ConsoleFeedback

PROMPT = """ YOUR PROMPT HERE """

def main():
    negotiator = Agent(
        agent_name='<agent name>',
        description='<agent description>',
        prompt=PROMPT,
        llm=OpenAI(),
    )

    negotiator.use(Calendar(), Gmail(), ConsoleFeedback())
    print('Negotiator: What\'s your task for me?')
    task = input('User: ')
    print('')
    negotiator.run(task)
```

### APP

Each APP is an Agent can interact with a specific software via natural human language.

#### API APP

The Agent uses the official API(typically OpenAPI or SDK) to interact with the specific software, such as: Google Calendar.

#### Browse APP

The Agent uses the browser to interact with the specific software, such as: Twitter. Currently, the Browser APP leverage
GPT-4V to understand Web UI and take actions.


## CLI

NPi provides a CLI tool to users with convenience. You can use CLI easily to test and debug the functionality of NPi.

You can see the CLI Reference [here](cli).

## SDK

NPi provides a Python SDK to users to create custom Agents and use various tools to perform specific tasks.
