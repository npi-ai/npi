## What is NPi?

NPi (**N**atural-language **P**rogramming **I**nterface), pronounced as **"N Ï€"**, is an open-source platform providing **_Tool-use_** APIs to empower AI agents with the ability to operate and interact with a diverse array of software tools and applications.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

### Installation

Begin by installing the NPi AI package via pip:

```sh
pip install npiai
```

### Create a New Tool

Let's create a new tool to compute the nth Fibonacci number. Start by crafting a new Python file titled `main.py` and insert the following snippet:


```python filename="main.py"
from npiai import FunctionTool, function


class MyTool(FunctionTool):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name='Fibonacci',
            description='My first NPi tool',
        )

    @function
    def fibonacci(self, n: int) -> int:
        """
        Get the nth Fibonacci number.

        Args:
            n: The index of the Fibonacci number in the sequence.
        """
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        if n == 1:
            return 1
        return self.fibonacci(n - 1) + self.fibonacci(n - 2)
```

### Run the Tool

You could use NPi tools in two different ways: `function mode` and `agent mode`. Let's explore both modes.

#### Function Mode

Function mode enables the integration of NPi tools with existing LLM-based AI application. In this mode, tools are packaged
as callable functions that the AI agent can invoke in response to user prompts, the chosen of functions will be decided by user-side agent.

```python filename="main.py"
import asyncio
import json
import os

from openai import OpenAI
from my_tool import MyTool


async def main():
    async with MyTool() as tool:
        print(f'The schema of the tool is\n\n {json.dumps(tool.tools, indent=2)}')
        client = OpenAI(api_key=os.getenv('OPENAI_API_KEY'))
        messages = [
            {
                "role": "user",
                "content": "What's the 10-th fibonacci number?",
            }
        ]
        response = client.chat.completions.create(
            model="gpt-4o",
            messages=messages,
            tools=tool.tools,
            tool_choice="auto",
            max_tokens=4096,
        )
        response_message = response.choices[0].message
        if response_message.tool_calls:
            result = await tool.call(tool_calls=response_message.tool_calls)
            print(f'The result of calling\n\n {json.dumps(result, indent=2)}')


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```json
[
  {
    "role": "tool",
    "name": "fibonacci",
    "tool_call_id": "call_UhkeQxrVr2LQoJOfUdR9WPdw",
    "content": "55"
  }
]
```

#### Agent Mode

Agent mode allows an NPi tools to serve as an independent Tool agents that can directly take plain queries and generate
responses. In this mode, the tool receives instructions, do `in-tool planning` to decide the sequence of function calling,
and returns the result as an output message. This mode simplify the problem-solving for domain-specific questions.
We suggest you use this mode in your Agentic AI applications.

```python filename="main.py"
import asyncio

from npiai import agent, Context
from my_tool import MyTool


async def main():
    async with agent.wrap(MyTool()) as tool:
        # make sure you have set the OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment variables
        result = await tool.chat(ctx=Context(), instruction="What's the 10-th fibonacci number?")
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

```sh
The answer: The 10th Fibonacci number is 55.
```
