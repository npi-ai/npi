# Discord

The Discord App facilitates communication with Discord channels by providing features that allow you to send or fetch messages.

import { Callout } from 'nextra/components';

<Callout type='info'>
  Please note that the Discord App is designed as a supplementary tool for an
  exisiting chatbot and does not actively listen for new messages. For effective
  operation, the app requires explicit identification of the target `user_id`,
  `channel_id`, and/or `message_id` within your instructions.
</Callout>
