# Overview

In this section, we explore the foundational principles of NPi and demonstrate how to integrate it into your projects.

## Concepts

### Agent

Within NPi, an Agent refers to a programmed entity designed to fulfill tasks based on human directives by utilizing a range of tools. Specifically, there are two categories of Agents:

- **App Agent**: This is a ready-to-use, pre-configured Agent within NPi, which is typically regarded as a **Tool**.

- **User Agent**: A customizable Agent, created with the NPi SDK, capable of harnessing various tools to execute bespoke tasks.

```python filename="examples/calendar_negotiator"
from openai import OpenAI

from npiai import Agent
from npiai import Gmail, Calendar
from npiai import ConsoleFeedback

PROMPT = """ YOUR PROMPT HERE """

def main():
    negotiator = Agent(
        agent_name='<agent name>',
        description='<agent description>',
        prompt=PROMPT,
        llm=OpenAI(),
    )

    negotiator.use(Calendar(), Gmail(), ConsoleFeedback())
    print('Negotiator: What\'s your task for me?')
    task = input('User: ')
    print('')
    negotiator.run(task)
```

### APP

An APP represents an NPi Agent with the capability to interface with a particular application through intuitive human language.


#### API APP

The API Apps utilize established APIs (usually OpenAPI or SDKs) to facilitate Agent interactions with software like Google Calendar.


#### Browse APP

The Browser Apps utilize a web browser to connect with applications (e.g., [Twitter](https://x.com)), leveraging tools like GPT-4V to understand and interact with web interfaces.

## CLI

NPi offers a user-friendly CLI tool for simplified testing and trouble-shooting of Agents in a command-line environment.

Refer to the CLI documentation [here](cli).

## SDK

NPi provides a Python SDK to users to create custom Agents and use various tools to perform specific tasks.
